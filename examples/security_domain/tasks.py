"""
Security-advisory task distribution for chunk 13 (e09 cross-domain
validation).

60 queries across the same 8 scenario classes as e03 (C1-C8), driven
against the synthetic 12-doc security corpus in
`e09_cross_domain_security/corpus.py`. Per-class TaskFeatures profiles
are copied verbatim from `e03_production_traffic/tasks.py` so the
rule-based regime detector produces the same regime labels per class
across domains (the framework should learn *cross-domain transfer* of
topology, not have to re-discover that "C5 is ambiguous"). The only
change vs e03 is the corpus + the user_task content.

The classes (same as e03):

  C1 — Single-doc factual extraction (simple lookups, fast solver wins,
       verifier skip)
  C2 — Multi-doc synthesis (combine 2-3 advisories, capable solver,
       verifier sometimes useful)
  C3 — Cross-doc consistency check (does the corpus contradict itself
       on this point? capable solver + verifier)
  C4 — Underspecified question with answer in corpus (capable solver
       qualifies the answer; verifier helps catch overreach)
  C5 — Question with no answer in corpus (capable solver + verifier
       must catch the gap; web search may help for context)
  C6 — Definitional / lookup (tight, single-source, fast solver wins)
  C7 — Multi-step reasoning (chain claims across advisories; capable
       solver + verifier; web search may add value)
  C8 — Numerical / specific-fact extraction (precise extraction,
       fast solver usually OK, lightweight verification useful)

Per-task fields (identical to e03's ProductionTask shape; named
`SecurityTask` here so the documents property points at OUR corpus,
not e03's):
  - id: stable identifier
  - scenario_class: C1..C8
  - user_task: the natural-language query
  - corpus_doc_ids: the corpus subset to expose to memory
  - corpus_has_answer: whether the corpus contains the answer (False for C5)
  - expected_optimal_variant: hint for analysis — which solver variant we
       expect the policy to converge to. Not given to the framework.
  - expected_verifier_value: "skip", "useful", "essential" — analysis hint
  - expected_web_value: "no", "complement", "essential" — analysis hint
  - notes_for_rubric: canonical-answer summary passed to RULER alongside
       the rubric

--- OSS PORT NOTES ---

Ported from agensflow/experiments/e09_cross_domain_security/tasks.py.

Two things dropped in this port:
  * TaskFeatures / CLASS_FEATURES — the OSS adapter's substrate uses a flat
    per-node signature (node name), not the paper's rich 12-tuple regime
    encoding. The features are unused here; they were a hint the paper's
    substrate consumed for regime detection.
  * `.features` property on SecurityTask — same reason.

Kept: all 60 tasks verbatim (id, scenario_class, user_task, corpus_doc_ids,
corpus_has_answer, expected_* analysis hints, notes_for_rubric).
