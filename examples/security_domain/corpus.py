"""
Synthetic security-advisory corpus for chunk 13 (e09 cross-domain
validation).

12 short advisory-style summaries on classic appsec vulnerability
classes. Deliberately synthetic (not real CVEs) so the experiment is
fully reproducible — anyone replicating runs identical content with
no link rot, no vendor takedowns, no judge-model contamination from
solver pretraining (the synthetic version uses fictional vendor
names, fake CVE IDs, and stylized claims).

The corpus is designed with deliberate coverage + deliberate gaps,
exactly the same way `e03_production_traffic/corpus.py` is structured:

  Coverage (12 docs, two per fictional vendor so cross-doc consistency
  tasks have natural pairings):
    - Acme Systems / AcmeCMS:      buffer overflow + stored XSS
    - Quartz Software / QuartzDB:  SQL injection + log-format RCE
    - Helios Networks / Gateway:   SSRF + DoS-via-recursion
    - Skyline Corp / Identity:     JWT bypass + weak PRNG
    - Polaris Tech / Vault:        local priv-esc + TOCTOU race
    - Beacon Labs / Mesh:          supply-chain dependency + IDOR

  Deliberate gaps (so Class-5 / no-answer-in-corpus tasks have real
  ground truth):
    - Kernel / OS-internal vulnerabilities (none)
    - Hardware side-channels (Spectre/Meltdown family) (none)
    - Cloud IAM misconfigurations (none)
    - Firmware / pre-boot supply-chain (none)
    - Network-layer attacks (BGP hijacking, DNS rebinding) (none)

  Text length: ~200-280 words each, comfortable for the memory agent's
  context window.

The advisory format follows the public-CVE convention loosely:
  ID, Title, Affected (product + version range), Reporter, Disclosed
  date, CVSS score + vector, Description (technical), Impact (what
  the attacker gains), Mitigation (patch + workaround).

            "group `B`, group `B` references group `C`, and group `C` "

            "Gateway across the fleet on next reload. The crash is "
